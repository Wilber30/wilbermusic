			Alongside my multi-instrumental compositions, I also write and arrange solo finger-style guitar instrumentals. 
			My guitar technique was initially inspired by listening to country-blues guitarists of early twentieth century; 
			in particular the wonderful finger-picking of Mississippi John Hurt. However, I have since arranged pieces in a 
			wide variety of styles using many different models of acoustic guitar.
